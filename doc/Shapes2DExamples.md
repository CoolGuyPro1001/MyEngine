# Exmaples Of Creating 2D Shapes
These are a examples of creating 2D shapes for 2D Rendering by using several functions from Shapes.h.
Each example will use a square, but the equivalent rectangle functions will have similiar results (except obviously looking like rectangles and not squares).
GUI Widgets will automatically create there own vertices with these functions.

# Creating A Square Using A Single Color
Let's set the color to red.

# Creating A Square Using Multiple Colors
The different colors will mix together in each triangle

# Creating A Square Using Texture Coordinates
Colors are cool and all, but textures are better.

# Creating A Square Using Texture Coordinates And A Color
We are will mix the texture of the cube with a color.
The color will mix with a the pixels from the texture in a technique called alpha blending.
Think of it like putting a colorful rectangle over an image in photoshop, and setting the rectangle's alpha color to low.
