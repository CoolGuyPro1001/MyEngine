# Oh Hello There

Edit 64 is a simplistic game engine and editor.
It was originally going to be a tool used to create *Super Mario 64 PC* mods, but I decided to just make it a game engine as well.
Hence why there is "64" at the end of each name.

It's designed to be lightweight. You can run games on a potato. This doesn't mean games will look awful, it just allows complete customization of the memory layout.


It has two main parts:
1. Editor64
2. Engine64


**Strevo Is A Testing Game. Have Fun Playing It! :)**

A library to help in game development. It has everything already with it. Just link the library, nothing else.
